This project aims to provide an easy-to-use and apply rudimentary approximation of a determinant study, so that practitioners (e.g. for preventions organisations) can feasibly quickly get an idea of which determinants are the most relevant in predicting a given target behavior in a given target population. We use the Google Document at https://docs.google.com/document/d/100S6QRpdl1lOe1ybuDnSxpI17uzUXMLhgOg4oU0TC8U/edit?usp=sharing to plan the first study.
