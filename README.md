This project aims to provide an easy-to-use and apply rudimentary approximation of a determinant study, so that practitioners (e.g. for preventions organisations) can feasibly quickly get an idea of which determinants are the most relevant in predicting a given target behavior in a given target population. To develop this method, we conduct a study comparing relative determinant levels for eight behaviors in the general population. This project is at the Open Science Framework at https://osf.io/2uwxp.
